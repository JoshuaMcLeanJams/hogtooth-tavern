Table of Basic Help Options (continued)
title	description
"Additional commands"	"Conversation and remembrance are two key parts of this adventure.

You can TALK TO (person) to initiate conversation, then ASK ABOUT (something). A shortcut is to ASK (person) ABOUT (something) which will initiate conversation and ask about the topic.

You can also TELL (something) or shorthand TELL (person) ABOUT (something) to inform other characters about people, places, or things.

Stuck? Try a plain THINK or PONDER for a general review what you've learned so far. Also, HINT will give you a menu of hints.

UNDO is enabled in this game because I'm a nice person. But be careful about overusing it. That's a good way to break the game. :(

If you have parchment and a pen, you can WRITE (message) ON PARCHMENT. Whenever you write a message, it overwrites the previous message. You can READ PARCHMENT to see the text and ERASE PARCHMENT to clear all text in it. If you're worried about overwriting the information in the notebook, use PROTECT PARCHMENT and the game will stop you from changing the text. Use UNPROTECT PARCHMENT if you want to edit it again.

You can EMPTY a container which drops everything in it onto the floor--including things you can't normally remove like liquids.

Check your SCORE to see how many points you've found. Some of these are secrets!"

Please put an asterisk * before commands which you mean to be notes. For example, you might type:

> * I don't think this is the correct room description.
