title	description	
"Additional commands"	"Conversation and remembrance are two key parts of this adventure.

You can TALK TO (person) to initiate conversation, then ASK ABOUT (something). A shortcut is to ASK (person) ABOUT (something) which will initiate conversation and ask about the topic.

You can also TELL (something) or shorthand TELL (person) ABOUT (something) to inform other characters about people, places, or things.

Stuck? Try a plain THINK or PONDER for a general review what you've learned so far. Also, HINT will give you a menu of hints.

UNDO is enabled in this game because I'm a nice person. But be careful about overusing it. That's a good way to break the game. :(

If you have parchment and a pen, you can WRITE (message) ON PARCHMENT. Whenever you write a message, it overwrites the previous message. You can READ PARCHMENT to see the text and ERASE PARCHMENT to clear all text in it. If you're worried about overwriting the information in the notebook, use PROTECT PARCHMENT and the game will stop you from changing the text. Use UNPROTECT PARCHMENT if you want to edit it again.

You can EMPTY a container which drops everything in it onto the floor--including things you can't normally remove like liquids.

Check your SCORE to see how many points you've found. Some of these are secrets!"

The king offered you a position on his Kingsguard, but you refused. That adventure was enough for your lifetime. So instead, you settled in as apprentice to a shopkeeper, starting your life anew.

Nine years later, you now run your own shop with a number of regular patrons and hardworking employees. It's much cozier than getting yourself killed like Galien did - and you don't miss the adventure. Not one bit."

Is that what you want?'[or]'If you haven't figured it out yet, you'll never figure it out.'[or]There is no response.[stopping]"

The thought of Saffi is "You married Saffi six years ago, right before opening up your own shop. She's been your constant companion ever since. The two of you have been waiting for the shop to stabilize before starting a family, and you're right on the cusp of it. Maybe next year."
